# TurtleBot3-SLAM-and-Obstacle-Avoidance
The script utilizes a controller for Turtlebot3 which implements obstacle avoidance and SLAM. The turtlebot will search for the nearest obstacle and circumnavigate the obstacle until it reaches the initial entry point of the object. The Turtlebot3 will also map the environment as it moves along.
